The blocktwine project aims to become a software foundation.
The goals of that foundation will be to build and maintain a hyperledger based blockchain network.
The purpose of that network will be to trade industrial hemp, its data and physical commodities, 
internationally and inter-organizationally.
The foundation will be governed by a panel of industry leaders. 
Representatives will come from a pool of people representing their company.

We are currently in the incubation phase and are looking for people and companies who wish to participate. Further discussion will be available in the [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) ‘blocktwine’ group.
