The blocktwine project aims to become a software foundation.
The goals of that foundation will be to build and maintain a hyperledger based blockchain network.
The purpose of that network will be to trade industrial hemp, its data and physical commodities, 
internationally and inter-organizationally.
The foundation will be governed by a panel of industry leaders. 
Representatives will come from a pool of people representing their company.

Some proposed use cases, 

- COA/Chain of custody, similar to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nrVlICgiYM Many state governments already have COA requirements, if those were optionally published on an immutable blockchain there could never be tampering.
- Digital marketplace, cross all borders, no take down of content i.e 'Zucking'
- IoT information, strains becomes intellectual property when the climate data is recorded. Generational research across organziations becomes possible. 

We are currently in the incubation phase and are looking for people and companies who wish to participate. Further discussion will be available in the [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) ‘blocktwine’ group.
