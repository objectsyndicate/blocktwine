# The Blocktwine Project
![blocktwine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectsyndicate/blocktwine/master/Diagram1.png)
#
The blocktwine project aims to become a software foundation.
The goals of that foundation will be to build and maintain a hyperledger based smart contract engine.
The purpose of the smart contract network will be to trade industrial hemp, its data and physical commodities, 
internationally and inter-organizationally. There are numerous advantages to the hemp industry for building a network such as this and participating in the foundation as opposed to a centralized solution or a currency based engine.

(I was wrong about some minor things, but generally this is the pitch)

Some goals of the project include,

- The network will be based on the hemp economy and not a digital currency. 
- The network will be maintained and governed by the foundation, as opposed to currency miners. 
- The foundation will be governed by a panel of industry leaders. 
- Representatives will come from a pool of people representing their company.
- The network will be a combined effort which may be capitalized upon in many ways.
- By joining forces and building the network the industry will have a new arsenal of tools at its disposal. These tools will decrease waste and increase revenue which is the motive to participate. 

Some proposed use cases, 

- COA/Chain of custody, Many state governments already have COA requirements, if those were optionally published on an immutable blockchain there could never be tampering.
- Digital marketplace, cross all borders, no take down of content i.e 'Zucking'
- IoT information, strains becomes intellectual property when the climate data is recorded. Generational research across organizations becomes possible. 

We are currently in the incubation phase and are looking for people and companies who wish to participate. Further discussion will be available in the [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) ‘blocktwine’ group.
